## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Translate to Roman Numerals"

_Difficulty Rating: Medium_

### Objectives

- Create a function which takes a given integer, `num`, and translates the integer into Roman numerals.
- Do not use a `for` loop.
- The output should be a string.

> i.e.:
> 
> input => `2020`
> 
> output => `'MMXX'`

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `npm i` from within the repo.
- Run `npm run test` or `npm test` to make sure the tests work. (They should fail.)
- Get hacking on the problem and test when you think you've got it!

### Notes

- **No for loops allowed.** Refer to the [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#iterators-and-generators) for more on why "for loops" are disadvantageous to other iterators.

Pull requests due by 11pm. Happy hacking!
